# FrobeniusNumberAndGenus

The purpose of this repository is to provide the functions used 
in the examples of the work "Semigroups with fixed multiplicity and embedding dimension".

Just download the file ```FrobeniusNumberAndGenus.m``` and execute it in ```Mathematica``` (the file can be downloaded directly by clicking [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JuanIgnacioGarciaUCA/FrobeniusNumberAndGenus/master/FrobeniusNumberAndGenus.m)). 
The functions of the library are ```ComputeMinimumGenusLme```, ```MinFrob```, ```FrobeniusEmbeddingDimensionMultiplicity```, ```ComputeEquivalenceClass```.
In our work, the commands are the following:
- ```ComputeMinimumGenusLme[5,3]```
- ```MinFrob[4,3]```
- ```FrobeniusEmbeddingDimensionMultiplicity[6,3,4]```
- ```ComputeEquivalenceClass[{6,7,8,9,11}]```
