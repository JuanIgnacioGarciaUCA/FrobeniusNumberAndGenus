# FrobeniusNumberAndGenus

The purpose of this repository is to provide the functions used 
in the examples of the work "Semigroups with fixed multiplicity and embedding dimension".

Just download the file ```FrobeniusNumberAndGenus.zip``` (clink on it and the button download), extract the file ```FrobeniusNumberAndGenus.m``` and run it ```Mathematica```. 
The functions of the library are ```ComputeMinimumGenusLme```, ```MinFrob```, ```FrobeniusEmbeddingDimensionMultiplicity```, ```ComputeEquivalenceClass```.

In our work, the commands are the following:
- ```ComputeMinimumGenusLme[5,3]```
- ```MinFrob[4,3]```
- ```FrobeniusEmbeddingDimensionMultiplicity[6,3,4]```
- ```ComputeEquivalenceClass[{6,7,8,9,11}]```
