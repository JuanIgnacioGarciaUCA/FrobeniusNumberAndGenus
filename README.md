# FrobeniusNumberAndGenus

The purpose of this repository is to provide the functions used 
in the examples of the work "Semigroups with fixed multiplicity and embedding dimension".

Just download the file ```FrobeniusNumberAndGenus.m``` and execute this library in ```Mathematica```. 
The functions used in our work are:
- ```ComputeMinimumGenusLme[5,3]```
- ```MinFrob[4,3]```
- ```FrobeniusEmbeddingDimensionMultiplicity[6,3,4]```
- ```ComputeEquivalenceClass[{6,7,8,9,11}]```
